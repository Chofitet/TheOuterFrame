  text: "Paved way back in 1940 over the deserted land of Wankchester, <link>Road
    54</link> starts at the end of Road 53.9. This pretext of a highway sees little
    to no traffic whatsoever as the surrounding populace tends to keep to themselves   
    \r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH CONTEXT -\r\n\r\nAt exactly 331 Km, and not
    a millimeter further, Road 54 counts with its one and only <u>Petro Station</u>.
    The thing is and I kid you not: placed EXACTLY at kilometer 331. This incredible
    feat of accuracy was commended by the unknown architect group of 2 friends. His
    brother remains unimpressed\r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH CONTEXT -\r\n\r\n<link>Road
    54</link>, as many a thing in life, finally ends at a cardinal crossroads that
    directs its travelers to its 3 nearest towns: \r\n\r\n<u>Whoopla Town</u> to
    the South, <u>Mermot Ales</u> to the West and <u>HiKen Biken</u> to the East.\r\n\r\nThe
    crash of an undisclosed <u>VTT</u> on Oct 30th is currently known as an Event
    (REDACTED). \n"
