  Text: "It's quite deserted. So we got lucky on that one. \nNothing much to see
    except for a 24/7 <link>Petro Station</link> that happens to be just 20(twenty)
    feet away from the <link>ill-fated truck</link> that we are currently trying
    to hide from everyone's eyes. So that's where our luck ends.\n \nAlso, some small
    vehicle was here recently. It left <link>three-wheeled tracks</link> on some
    <link>radioactive-looking green goo</link> that spilled from the back of <link>the
    cargo</link>. Its a smear that continues far on the same direction the transport
    was going."
  TextForRepetition: We already did that, just check that report or the DB.
