  Text: "Ok. First of all, It's quite deserted. So we got lucky on that one. \nNothing
    much to see except for a 24/7 <link>Petro Station</link> that just happens to
    be 20(twenty) feet away from our <link>ill-fated truck</link>, which we're currently
    trying to hide. That's where our luck ends."
  TextForRepetition: We already did that, just check that report or the DB.
