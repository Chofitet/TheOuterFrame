  Text: "It's quite deserted. So we got lucky on that one. \nNothing much to see
    except for a 24/7 <link>Petro Station</link> that just happens to be 20(twenty)
    feet away from the <link>ill-fated truck</link>, that we are currently trying
    to hide from everyone's eyes... So that's where our luck ends."
  TextForRepetition: We already did that, just check that report or the DB.
