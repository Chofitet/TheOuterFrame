  Text: "We did it! We are inside! \nIt's a cluster of mess, there's equipment thrown
    about and <link>green stuff</link> everywhere. \nMore importantly a big dark
    glass box labeled <link>VESSEL Q7-016</link> is laying shattered on the floor.
    And it has a big hole. And it's empty... \nWhatever was in it has liquified into
    <link>green goo</link> or escaped. \n\nThere's a code printed on the inside of
    the broken vessel: <link>E-CODE b02i2E90L</link>. \n\nOur bet is on something
    being on the loose, Boss. "
