    around and <link>green stuff</link> everywhere. \nMore importantly a big dark
    glass vessel labeled <link>VESSEL Q7-016</link> has completely shattered on one
    side. And it's empty... \nWhatever was in it was liquified into <link>green goo</link>
    or escaped. \n\nThere's a code printed on the inside of the broken case: <link>E-CODE
