  Text: "It\u2019s a VTT. That has crashed right through a <link>billboard that reads
    \"Don't forget to text Mom on her day\"</link>. The front is completely caved
    in at the passenger\u2019s side, it seems like something threw it out of the
    road. Whatever it hit, <link>it was BIG</link>. \r\n\r \n<link>The cargo compartment</link>
    is locked and <link>the driver</link> is nowhere to be found. \r\n\r\nIf it wasn't
    for some <link>radioactive looking goo</link> seeping through the backdoors I'd
    said everything is well not so OK but... this is bad. This is a bad one right
    here. We need to access this thing pronto to check the real status of the situation.\r\n"
