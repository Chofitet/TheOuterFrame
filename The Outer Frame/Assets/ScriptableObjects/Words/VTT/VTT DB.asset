  text: "Vessel Transport Trucks (VTT) are vehicular cargo containments used for
    (REDACTED) transfer between facilities, final repose locations and/or through
    (REDACTED). The acronym was adopted after their former name was deemed too long
    and telling to be recognized as practical. \r\n\r \nNot one VTT is the same as
    another, each possesses a distinct non-assumable exterior to avoid the (REDACTED)
    and public's suspicion. As of last update the current number of exterior variations
    actually goes as high as (REDACTED). \n \r\nVTT routes and time of circulation
    are determined by delivery type and population density to minimize extraneous
    situations. Nevertheless VTTs are not strangers to hijacks or <u>VTTD</u>s going
    rogue. For a complete list of (REDACTED) casualties refe \r\n\r \n- CONTENT EDITED
    TO MATCH CONTEXT - \r\n\r \nA VTT <link>cargo</link> can hold up to (REDACTED)
    (REDACTED) per square unit, and are standardized to withheld the known vast array
    of (REDACTED), being able to transfer multiples if required to, though it\u2019s
    highly advisable to avoid reaching or surpassing said condition. \r\nCargo doors
    do not open manually by design, each delivery has a unique designated (REDACTED)
    given to its corresponding (REDACTED) which is passed on on arrival. It is by
    (REDACTED) this (REDACTED) on a (REDACTED) terminal that cargo doors can be opened.
