    vehicular cargo containments used to transfer (REDACTED) between facilities and/or
    through (REDACTED).\r\nNot one VTT is the same as another, as each one possesses
    a distinct non-assumable exterior to avoid (REDACTED) and the public's suspicion.\r\nVTT
    routes and time of circulation are determined by delivery type and population
    density.\r\n\r\nVTT <link>cargo</link> can hold up to (REDACTED) (REDACTED) per
    square unit, though it\u2019s highly advisable to avoid reaching said condition.\r\nCargo
    doors do not open manually by design, each delivery has a unique designated code
    given to its corresponding (REDACTED) passed on arrival. It is by (REDACTED)
    this code on a (REDACTED) that cargo doors are (REDACTED).\r\n\r\nFor further
