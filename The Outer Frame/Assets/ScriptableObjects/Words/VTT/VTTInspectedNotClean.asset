  Text: "It\u2019s a VTT. That has crashed right through a <link>big sign that reads
    \"Don't forget to text Mom on her day\"</link>. The front is completely caved
    in at the passenger\u2019s side, it seems like something threw it out of the
    road. Whatever it hit, <link>it was BIG</link>. \n<link>The cargo compartment</link>
    is locked and <link>the driver</link> is nowhere to be found. \n \nIf it wasn't
    for some <link>green goo</link> seeping through the backdoors I'd said everything
    is well not so OK but. . . this is bad. This is a bad one right here. \nWe need
    to access this thing pronto to get a real hold of the situation. "
