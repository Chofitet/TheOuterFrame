    \nLooks like no one's home right now. \nThe place is quite lived in, with a little
    kitchen, a bean chair, it even has its own bidet!  There are lots of Coarsie
    Shampoo bottles, and an old broken desktop PC. \n \nThere's a note on the ground.
    \n \nIt reads: \n\"Someone like me. \nThanks, <link>friend</link>\"  \n"
