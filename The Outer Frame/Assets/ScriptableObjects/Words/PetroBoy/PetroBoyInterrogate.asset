  Text: "The boy swears he that heard it all but saw nothing. He hasn't gone outside. 
    \n\"Leave the register alone? My boss would kill me!\"\nHe says there was a big
    screech of tires and <link>something BIG</link> crashed, like a two-trucks crash.
    There were some scraps of metal noises that lasted for a while and then the scariest
    roar you ever heard. \n\"Something was mean angry out there\". \n\nAlso, he is
    the one who called the news...\nAnd he's overexcited to talk to them when they
    arrive about what he THINKS it happened.  \nHe liked telling us THAT idea... "
