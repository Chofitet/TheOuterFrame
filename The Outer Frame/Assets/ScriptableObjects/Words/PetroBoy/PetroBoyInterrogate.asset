  Text: "The boy swears he saw nothing. \r\nHe didn't go outside when whatever happened
    happened. \n\r\n\"Leave the register alone? My boss would kill me!\" \n \r\nBut
    he HEARD it all. \n\rIn short: around 5 to 4 AM there were some weird mooing
    sounds, \u201Csome special cow must have escaped\u201D, followed by a sudden
    screech of tires, and then <link>something BIG</link> crashed. \u201CIt sounded
    like a boulder struck something kinda crash\". \r\nThere was a long silence after
    that. Interrupted by screaming and a deafening roar. \r\n\"Something was mean
    angry out there.\"  \r\nIt sounded like a small stampede passed by. \r\nAnd then
    nothing. \n\r\nAlso: he is the one who called the news... \r\nAnd he's over excited
    about  appearing on TV sharing what he THINKS it happened.  \r\nHe liked telling
    us THAT idea... \r"
