  Text: "We had a chat with the kid.\n \r\nYou know. About what maybe kinda certainly
    happens to people who talk way out of turn.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what? He seems to
    have lost all that fiery enthusiasm for sharing what he THOUGHT that happened
    here tonight.\r\n\r\nHe'll mind his tongue. \n\nWe won\u2019t need to worry about
    him spilling the beans or getting in our way.\r"
  TextForRepetition: We already did that, just check the corresponding report or
    the DB.
