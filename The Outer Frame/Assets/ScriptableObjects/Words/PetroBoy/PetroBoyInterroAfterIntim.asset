  Text: "The boy swears he saw nothing.  \nHe didn't go outside when wathever-it-was
    happenned. \n\n\"Leave the register alone? My boss would kill me!\" \n\nBut he
    HEARD it all.  \nIn short: around 5 to 4 there were some weird mooing sounds
    followed by a sudden screech of tires and <link>something BIG</link> crashed,
    \"like a two crashes crash\". \n\nAfter that there was a long silence that was
    interrupted by some screaming and a deafening roar.\n\"Something was mean angry
    out there\". \n\nAlso, he is the one who called the news...\nBut after the talk
    we had we won't need to worry about him spilling the beans."
