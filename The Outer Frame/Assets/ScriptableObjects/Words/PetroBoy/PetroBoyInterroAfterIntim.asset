  Text: "The boy swears he saw nothing.  \r\nHe didn't go outside when whatever happened
    happened.  \r\n\r\n\"Leave the register alone? My boss would kill me!\"  \r\n\r\nBut
    he HEARD it all. \r\n\rIn short: around 5 to 4 AM there were some weird mooing
    sounds, \u201Csome special cow must have escaped\u201D, followed by a sudden
    screech of tires, and then <link>something BIG</link> crashed. \u201CIt sounded
    like a boulder struck something kinda crash\". \r\n\r\nThere was a long silence
    after that. Interrupted by screaming and a deafening roar.\r\n\"Something was
    mean angry out there.\" \r\nIt sounded like a small stampede passed by. \r\nAnd
    then nothing. \r\n\r\nAlso: he is the one who called the news... \r\nBut after
    that talk we already had there\u2019s no need to worry about him spilling the
    beans. \r\n"
