  Text: "All done. \n \nClean as a whistle. \n \nHe won't remember anything from
    tonight. \n \nWe kept his instilled obedience to (REDACTED) and his respect to
    us. \n \nAlso he now thinks the truck was delivered and that current Tv news
    anchors are inborn liars.  \n  \nHe muttered something about <link>the code</link>?
    \n \nLooks pretty confused about how he got here now, though. \n "
  TextForRepetition: "We did that already. \nRemember to read the Reports.\n\nAlso
