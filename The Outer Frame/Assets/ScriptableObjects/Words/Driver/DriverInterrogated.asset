  Text: "The driver's name is <link>Sergio Raracara</link>. He might be suffering
    from a concusion but swears that out of nowhere the  biggest cow he has ever
    seen jumped in front of the truck and h blacked out when the crash happened.\nWhen
    he woke up, he found the truck cargo door open and he closed it without looking
    inside as he is not allowed to interact with the cargo.  \r\n"
