  Text: "The driver's name is <link>Sergio Raracara</link>. \nHe might be suffering
    from a concussion, but swears that out of nowhere the <link>BIGGEST cow</link>
    he has ever seen jumped in front of the truck while giving him the finger and
    that he blacked out when the truck impacted with the thing.\n\nWhen he woke up,
    he found the <link>cargo</link> door open so he closed it without looking inside
    as he is not allowed to interact with it until delivery.\r"
