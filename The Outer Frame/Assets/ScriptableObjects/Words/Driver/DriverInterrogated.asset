  Text: "The guy is really scared(even thou he doesn't look it).\nHis name is <link>Sergio
    Raracara</link>. \nHe knows he works for us so no need to worry about squealing.\nHe
    might be suffering from a concussion, but swears that out of nowhere, while he
    was \"driving his own bussines\", <link>the BIGGEST cow he has ever seen</link>
    jumped at full cow-speed in front of the truck. \n\nWhen he woke up, the cow
    was no more but the <link>cargo</link> doors were open. So he closed them without
    looking inside as he's not allowed to interact with wathever it's there. "
