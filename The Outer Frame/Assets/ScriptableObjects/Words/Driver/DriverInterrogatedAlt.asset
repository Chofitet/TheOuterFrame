  Text: "The driver's name is <link>Sergio Raracara</link>. \nHe knows he works for
    us so no need to worry about squealing. He might be suffering from a concussion,
    but swears that out of nowhere, while he was \"driving his own bussines\", <link>the
    BIGGEST cow he has ever seen</link> jumped at full cow-speed in front of the
    truck. \n\nWhen he woke up, the cow was no more but the <link>cargo</link> doors
    were open. So he closed them without looking inside as he's not allowed to interact
    with wathever it's there. \n\nBut he gave us the <link>Delivery 285-P9</link>.
    Maybe that's something. "
