  text: '<b>DRIVER</b>


    Vessel Transport Truck Drivers (VTTDs) are common truck
    drivers contracted under a significant payment to keep them happy and quiet.


    VTTDs
    are not allowed to question orders.


    As such VTTDs are not afiliated with
    THE AGENCY, they just deliver the truck without interacting with it''s content.


    To
    counteract the possibility of a VTTDs going rogue we install nano adherent tracking
    devices on the VTTs seats to keep global track of each one and subsequently find
    them.'
