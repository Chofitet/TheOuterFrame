  Text: 'They are two individuals deeply scarred by a terrorific shared experience
    the likes of which will either reforge or eat their relationship from the inside
    out till there''s nothing left to hold on to.


    They can only mutter what
    seem''s to be their now colective name: " <link>Jeff & Deandra</link> ".


    They
    don''t appear to be injured in anyway other that emotionally.
