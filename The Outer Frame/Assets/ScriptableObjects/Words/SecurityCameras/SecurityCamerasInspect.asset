  Text: "These are not CCTVs at all, they are cheap webcams disguised as high-tech
    surveillance equipment.\nRegardless of that, some are pointing directly at us

    to any footage captured by those things. \nMaybe they saw the crash."
  TextForRepetition: We alredy did that. Check the corrsponding report or the DB.
