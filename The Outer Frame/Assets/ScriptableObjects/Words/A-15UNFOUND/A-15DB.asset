  text: "A-15 is an (REDACTED) polymorphic (REDACTED) lifeform that can take the
    shape of and mimic to perfection any being that it (REDACTED) when come into
    contact.\r\nEven though it harnesses the memories of whatever it takes (REDACTED)
    (REDACTED) and there are some clear influences into play: somehow the (REDACTED)
    possesses its own will. \r\nIt is extremely attracted to unusual DNA, its attention
    shifting violently when in close proximity to a being not YET added to its engorged
    genetic pool.\r\n\r\nThe specimen was found outside of the (REDACTED) insides
    which is what made it possible to capture in a (REDACTED) state.\r\nIts original
    form is unknown, and due to its need to imitate it is thought as harmless, likely
    of a class (REDACTED) (REDACTED).\r\n\r\nA-15 becomes whatever it (REDACTED),
    it is not simple (REDACTED), as such it\u2019s of the highest value for experimentation
    and processing as an all in one subject.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------
