  text: "<link>A-15</link> is an (REDACTED) polymorphic (REDA) lifeform that can
    take the shape of and mimic to perfection any being that it (REDACTED) when come
    into close proximity.\r\nEven though it harnesses the memories of whatever it
    (REDA) (REDACTED) and there are some clear influences into play: somehow the
    (REDACTED) possesses its own will. \r\nIt is extremely attracted to unusual DNA,
    its attention shifting violently when in close proximity to a being not YET added
    to its engorged genetic pool.\r\n\r\nThe specimen was found outside of the (REDA)
    insides which is what made it possible to capture in a (REDACTED) state.\r\nIts
    original form is unknown, and due to its need to imitate it is thought as harmless,
    likely of a class (REDACTED) (RE).\r\n\r\nA-15 becomes whatever it (REDACTED),
    it is not simple (REDA), as such it\u2019s of the highest value for experimentation
    and processing as an all in one subject.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
