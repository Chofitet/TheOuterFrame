  Text: "He's SUPER happy to comply now. \nIt happened like this: \nHe received a
    S.O.S MIKE SMS at 03.46 but when he arrived, he didn't found a car nor a tricycle,
    but a giant cow-thing taking a driver out of a crashed truck. It didn't notice
    him as he tricycled in. \"<link>Mora</link> had the heebie-jeebies\". \nSomething
    was glowing at the back of the vehicle. \"I like shiny things, you can't sue
    me\". \nSuddenly a lot of green stuff came out all at once from there and he
    heard \"the roar of gorilla\" so he turned back home as fast as Mora could take
    me.  \nSays he couldn't get a clear look at the <link>thing</link> that came
    out of the <link>truck</link>,  but when he looked back he found himself being
    double followed. \n\"Ever been chased by a <link>7-foot tall cow</link> and it's
    <link>intergalactic friend</link> down the <link>road</link> in the middle of
    a moonless night?\" \nThey ran behind him for a while but IT took to the EAST
    near the crossroads, maybe it was looking for a place to hide after it fed. \n\nHe
    thinks it ate the <link>cow</link>. "
