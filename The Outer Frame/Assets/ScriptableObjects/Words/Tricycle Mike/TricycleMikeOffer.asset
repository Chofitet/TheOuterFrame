  Text: "He's SUPER happy to comply now. \r\nIt happened like this: \r\nAt 03.46
    he received a S.O.S MIKE, so he and the missus went to help but when they arrived
    there was no car nor tricycle there. \r\n<link>A giant cow-thing</link> was taking
    <link>a driver</link> out of a crashed <link>truck</link>. \r\nSomething started
    glowing at the back of the vehicle, and as soon as they came close it started
    flushing green stuff everywhere. That\u2019s when they heard the roar.\r\r\n\"<link>Mora</link>
    still has the heebie-jeebies\". \r\nHe couldn't get a clear look at what chased
    them, but Mora saw they were two. \r\n\"Ever been chased by a <link>9-foot tall
    cow</link> and its <link>intergalactic friend</link> down the <link>road</link>
    in the middle of a moonless night? Excuse us for not stopping to take a picture!\".
    \r\nThey ran behind them for a while until IT took EAST near the crossroads.
    \r\n\u201CMaybe it was looking for a place to hide after it fed.\u201C \r\n\r\u201CLike
    the woods in <link>Whoopla Town</link>.\u201D \n\nHe thinks it ate the cow. \r\n"
