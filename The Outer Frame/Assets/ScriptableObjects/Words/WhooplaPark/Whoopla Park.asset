  text: "<link>Whoopla Park</link> woods is an enormous dense canopy of pines (not
    dense enough to be considered a forest) fenced off the east of <u>Whoopla Town</u>
    as a means to keep its rich fauna and flora out of greedy hands.\r\n\r\nThe reservation
    is preserved by blind faith and good will, there are no park rangers nor any
    kind of security except for the big fence. The whole area is left to fend by
    itself, \u201CNature kinda sorts it\u201D. This uneducated approach to not mapping
    your surroundings has led to many getting stupendously lost in this unmapped
    region so entering is discouraged.\r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH CONTEXT -\r\n\r\nEvery
    Whoopla child is taught as a youngster \u201Cyou get in the woods, we get another
    kid\u201D.\r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH CONTEXT -\r\n\r\nThe <u>mustard caribou</u>,
    the <u>stripped mole</u> and the <u>winking salmon</u> are some of its m\r\n\r\n-

    something new today!\u201D long after changing the park's policy about touring.\r\n"
