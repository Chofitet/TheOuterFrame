  text: "<link>Whoopla Town</link> formerly known as Whoopla City (downgraded after
    the chicanery of 68), is the home of 7 thousand Whooplians making it <u>South
    Wankchester</u>s denser town.\r\nAs a semi rural post urban pseudo area, Whoopla
    Town is an infrastructural mess, its people don't believe in tearing down the
    past so everything is preserved by building above and around it. They literally
    put a school above a bar above a ranch. The whole place is a rickety nightmare,
    that groans under its own weight, where you can truly \u201Chear the sights\u201D.\r\n\r\n-
    CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH CONTEXT - \r\n\r\nIt is also home of a huge natural reservation
    called <u>Whoopla Park</u>. These dense woods are filled to the brim with indigenous
    fauna and flora.\r\nYou can check our <u>Whoopla Park</u> entry for more information
    about the woods and woods like things and stuff.\r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH
    CONTEXT -\r\n\r\nThough miles away from the ocean, the town has its own naval
    base, being true to their pre-emptive motto \u201CJust in case\u201D. Their tagline
    \u201CHome of the <u>Spiderworm Pie</u>\u201D is teached as a clear example of
    commercial suicide in \r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED TO MATCH CONTEXT -\r\n\r\n --------------(REDACTED)-----\r\n
