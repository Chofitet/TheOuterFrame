  text: "As of today, an exceptional number of cows have trampled the limits of our
    imagination. Many of which are known to man, such are the likes of <u>the Fire
    Cow of Milkwalkie</u>, <u>the Udder in the Sky</u> and <u>the Tim</u>. \nHer
    name was Pig, daughter of the smallest cow known to man, <u>Big Betty</u>. She
    wasn\u2019t much found as she was already there, in the beggining there was always
    cow.\r\n\r\nAs a severely plus-sized cow, she feared nothing at all except for
    (REDACTED). As a result, meticulous protocols and methods were put in place to
    keep (REDA) and (REDACTED) separated.\r\nMaybe as a token of good will to humankind
    she did not do that much, and kept to herself once she went to (REDA) prancing
    to a tune under the protective (REDACTED) layers (RE) (REDACTED) of where she
    was kept until THE BIG (REDACTED) COMEUPPANCE.\r\n\r\nHer whereabouts are not
    known, but pretend like you do. It makes us look smart.\r\n\r\n- CONTENT EDITED
